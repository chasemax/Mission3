<p>
    I hope to get a lot out of this class. First, I hope to expand upon my web development skills and
    understanding the frameworks that go behind ASP.NET. I believe that, after learning this and the Python/Django
    framework, I'll be able to pick up any web development tools with relative ease. Second, I hope to improve my
    general coding skills. Third, I hope to learn how to work in a group even better than I did last semester.
